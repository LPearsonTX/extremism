# Sharing the GWU Extremism tracking data related to the events of 1/6/2021

Repository for code to build interactive dash application for data pulled from the GWU extremism tracker

Current Files:
* Extremism.py, python file with code for standalone dash app
* Extremism.ipynb, jupyter notebook file used to develop the code. May fall out of sync with update .py file

Planned TODO: 
1) Update code for live data pull.  Current project references a data copy in the 'data' folder as url gives 403 error.
2) Launch Dash app on heroku
